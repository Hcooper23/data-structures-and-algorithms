# Min Value Trees

## Features

Write a function to find the node with minimum value in a Binary Search Tree.

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be contextual, descriptive, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Solution
<!-- class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function findMinimum(root) {
  if (root === null) {
    return null;
  }

  let current = root;
  while (current.left !== null) {
    current = current.left;
  }

  return current;
} -->

# Understanding and Implementing Merge Sort Algorithm

## Introduction:

In this article, we will dive into the Merge Sort algorithm, which is an efficient and popular sorting algorithm. We will explain the step-by-step process of Merge Sort using pseudocode and then provide a working implementation in JavaScript. Along the way, we will visually demonstrate the output after each iteration for a given sample array.

## Merge Sort Algorithm:

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input array into smaller halves until we have single-element or empty subarrays. It then merges these subarrays in a sorted manner to produce the final sorted array. The algorithm consists of two main functions: Mergesort and Merge.

## Pseudocode Explanation:

1. Mergesort function:

- The Mergesort function takes an array as input.
- If the length of the array is greater than 1, it proceeds with the sorting process.
- It divides the array into two halves: left and right.
- It recursively calls Mergesort on the left and right halves.
- Finally, it merges the sorted left and right halves using the Merge function.

2. Merge function:

- The Merge function takes three arrays as input: left, right, and arr (the main array to be sorted).
- It uses three pointers i, j, and k to track the indices of left, right, and arr, respectively.
- While both i and j are within the respective lengths of left and right, it compares the elements at left[i] and right[j].
- If left[i] is less than or equal to right[j], it assigns left[i] to arr[k] and increments i and k by 1.
- Otherwise, it assigns right[j] to arr[k] and increments j and k by 1.
- After the above loop, if there are any remaining elements in either left or right, it copies them to the remaining positions in arr.

## Visual Step-by-Step Output for Sample Array [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]:

1. Initial Array: [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]

- No change since the length is not greater than 1.

2. Final Sorted Array: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]

### Conclusion:

Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. In this article, we explained the step-by-step process of Merge Sort using pseudocode and provided a working implementation in JavaScript. We also demonstrated the output after each iteration for a sample array. Merge Sort is widely used in practice due to its time complexity of O(n log n) and stability in sorting.

# tree-intersection

## Features
Specifications

- Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md
- Create a branch in your repository called tree-intersection
- On your branch, createâ€¦

  - JavaScript: a folder named treeIntersection which contains a file called tree-intersection.js

- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
  - NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.

Feature Tasks

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Approach & Efficiency

## Solution
<!-- class BinaryTree {
  // Binary tree implementation
  // Define the necessary properties and methods
}

function treeIntersection(tree1, tree2) {
  const set1 = treeToSet(tree1);
  const set2 = treeToSet(tree2);

  const intersectionSet = new Set();

  for (const value of set1) {
    if (set2.has(value)) {
      intersectionSet.add(value);
    } -->

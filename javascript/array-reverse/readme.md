## Approach & Efficiency

Modified array in place to yield a time efficiency of 0(n) and a space efficiency of 0(1).

## Solution

- Code
<!-- const reverseArray = (arr) => {
	let front = 0;
	let end = arr.length - 1;

	while(end > front){
		let temp = arr[front];
		arr[front] = arr[end];
		arr[end] = temp;
		front++;
		end--;
	}
	return arr;
} -->
